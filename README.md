# API-Homework
##Timothy Wardlow

#### In this homework activity, focused on using APIs, we created two financial analysis tools.
#### The first; a personal finance planner that will allow users to visualize their savings composed by investments in shares and cryptocurrencies to assess if they have enough money as an emergency fund.
#### The second; a retirement planning tool that uses the Alpaca API to fetch historical closing prices for a retirement portfolio composed of stocks and bonds, then runs Monte Carlo simulations to project the portfolio performance at 30 years. We then used the Monte Carlo data to calculate the expected portfolio returns given a specific initial investment amount.

### This activity was very fun for me. I've thoroughly enjoyed learning about and working with APIs. I look forward to applying this knowledge to future projects.
